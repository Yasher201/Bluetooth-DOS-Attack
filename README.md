## Description
The purpose of this project was to compare the bluetooth security architecture between iOS and Android devices. We tested using a iPhone 11 Pro Max for an iOS device and we used a Samsung Galaxy S9+ for an Android Device. In order to simulate our project we developed a Python Script and sent packets and threads to the iOS and Android device while it was connected to a bluetooth speaker and playing music.
